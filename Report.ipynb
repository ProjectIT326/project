Clustering Task:\nGoal: Group students into clusters based on their responses to various stress-related factors to identify common stress profiles.\nFeatures/Attributes: All columns except \"Stress Level\" could be used to form clusters to identify patterns without predefined outcomes.\nThese tasks can help uncover underlying patterns in how stress factors affect different groups of students and predict stress levels based on measurable attributes, aiding in targeted interventions. Let's proceed with the analysis or further refine these tasks based on your specific goals. ​​\n",
